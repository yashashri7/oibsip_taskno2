                About the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.  
            </h1>  
<p>  
                ☛ Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born on 16th Feb 1630 at shivneri fort district pune.<br><br>  
                ☛ He is a founder of the Maratha kingdom of India. The kingdom’s security was based on religious toleration and on the functional integration of the Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.<br><br>  
                ☛ A devout Hindu, he grew up at a time when India was ruled by Muslims, and he found their religious persecution intolerable.<br><br>  
                ☛ Collecting a band of followers, he began in c. 1655 to seize weak outposts of the sultan of Bijapur. In 1659 he lured the sultan’s army to its destruction and, possessed of its horses and armaments, became overnight a formidable warlord.  
                <br><br> ☛ The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb sent out his most prominent general and an army of 100,000 to capture him, but Shivaji made a daring escape.   
                <br><br> ☛ Gaining even more strength, he added a naval force to his military might. In 1674 he proclaimed himself an independent sovereign.  
                <br><br> ☛ He forged an alliance with the sultans in the south, thereby blocking the spread of Mughal rule. His rule was noted for its religious tolerance.
